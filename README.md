# tourism-prediction-blue-nalu-analytics-consulting

🌊 Project Overview
This repository contains the work for Phase II of a groundbreaking municipal data project in partnership with Blue Nalu Analytics (BNA). We're building predictive models to forecast visitor presence in Surf City, NC, weeks in advance using real-world data inputs.
The Challenge
Small coastal towns like Surf City, NC face significant challenges managing tourism surges with limited staffing and no predictive infrastructure. Our project addresses this by creating a forecasting system that enables:

Public safety staffing optimization
Emergency clinic readiness planning
Data-driven business recommendations

🎯 Project Goals

Build robust visitor presence forecasting models
Implement persona-based demand prediction (not just raw headcount)
Create a replicable framework for municipal demand forecasting
Deploy real-world beta testing solutions

📊 Data Sources
Our multi-source data ecosystem includes:

Demographics Data - ZIP code level demographic information
Historical Weather - Weather patterns and forecasts
Foot Traffic Data - Daily location-based data from Placer.ai (used by Lowe's, municipalities, and top retailers)
Property Management Bookings - Booking data including guest capacity, timing, and origin ZIP codes
Event Data - Holidays, festivals, and special events

🛠 Technical Stack
Data Engineering & Analysis

Google BigQuery - Raw data storage and processing
SQL - Data exploration, cleaning, and transformation
Python/R - Modeling and analysis

Visualization & Deployment

Tableau - Data visualization and stakeholder dashboards
Machine Learning Models - Predictive forecasting algorithms

Visitor Personas
Working with a segmentation model built from 8,905 ZIP codes across the U.S., featuring 4 distinct visitor personas:

Day Trippers - Short-duration visitors
Vacation Families - Extended stay tourists
Business Travelers - Work-related visits
Special Event Attendees - Festival/event-driven visitors

Each persona has unique patterns affecting timing, duration, and local business impact.
